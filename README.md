## Key Takeaways
From our graphs, we can say conclusively that the access to the internet is strongly
correlated to income level distribution and also affects highschool studentsâ€™ chance to
pursue a STEM degree in university. As income level increases, digital access
increases, which leads to higher STEM degrees awarded. However, there was little that
we can say about the relation between racial distributions and internet access, other
than that White and Asian seem to access more than Black and Hispanic. Interestingly,
we can also see this same correlation between racial distributions and income levels.
But more research needs to be done to have a clear conclusion about this.

Internet access and STEM degrees distribution in the US is very far from uniform.
Rather than being evenly spread out, access to the internet is seen in areas with the
highest income populations, such as California, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, and
much of the east coast.
